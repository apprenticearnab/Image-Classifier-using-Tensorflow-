This is a simple approach to classify mnist datasets using tensorflow.Here I am using Recurrent Neural Networks to classify the Images. Recurrent neural networks is a type of deep learning-oriented algorithm, which follows a sequential approach.It uses LSTM or Long Short Term Memory.It is a very good approach.I am very grateful for contributing to this repository.
